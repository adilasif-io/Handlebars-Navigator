### Navigate to Partial Definition

1. Open an HTML file with handlebars in Visual Studio Code
2. Use Ctrl+Click on a partial. Ex: {{>_partial-name}}
3. \_partial-name.html will be opened

   **Please note, Partials should exist as an html file in the "src>partials" folder. Can be any subfolders after that.**

2. Press CTRL + SHIFT + /

### Create a Partial from Selected Code

1. Select the code you want to convert into a partial.  
2. Press the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + P` (or use the command palette) to run the `Create Partial` command.  
3. Enter a name for the partial in the input box.  
4. The selected code will:  
   - Be moved to a new file in the `src/partials` folder.  
   - The file will be saved with the name you provided and a `.html` extension.  
   - A reference to the new partial (e.g., `{{> partial-name }}`) will replace the selected code in the current file.  

   **Note:** If the `src/partials` folder does not exist, it will be created automatically.
